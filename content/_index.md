DevOps Engineer.
{{< /lead >}}

I'm a geek that loves cats, cars and computers.

# My Work

I currently work for Mercedes-Benz as my main job. Other things I do are some research and hacky things such as Hackintosh, trying new Linux distros and some new paradigms for computing, such as web-first desktops and the likes.

# My Cats

Love them! My two cats are my passion, you could see them here on Instagram if you follow me.
